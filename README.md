# JuliaMPIMonteCarlo
Illustrates using Julia and MPI to do Monte Carlo. Release v1.0 contains the versions used in the paper "A Note on Julia and MPI, with Code Examples" (see http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-015-9516-5). Since then, montecarlo.jl and the pi example have been incorporated in the MPI.jl package (https://github.com/JuliaParallel/MPI.jl), and the interface has changed slightly. The pi example has been deleted from this repo, and the Auction example has been updated to use the new interface.
